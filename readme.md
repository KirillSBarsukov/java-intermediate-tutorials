### Object Oriented Programming
	A - Abstraction
	P - Polymorphism
	I - Inheritance
	E - Encapsulation
	
------	
####ABSTRACTION 
------
* Focus on essentials/idea rather than specific details/events
* Ignore the irrelevant or unimportant

**Abstract Class**
* May or may not contain abstract methods (Eg- method without body: ```public void get();```  )
* But, if a class have at least one abstract method, then the class must be declared abstract.
* If a class is declared abstract it cannot be instantiated.
* To use an abstract class you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.
* If you inherit an abstract class you have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it

:point_right: Lesson 15 : Abstract Class<br />

**Abstract Method**

:point_right: Lesson 16 : Abstract Method<br />

------
####POLYMORPHISM 
------
* Many Forms/Behaviour
* It is of two types
	* Static Binding - Compile time polymorphism 
		* Eg: Method Overloading
	* Dynamic Binding - Runtime polymorphism
		* Eg: Method Overridding

**Method Overloading**
* Same Method name
* Different parameter
* Different behavior

:point_right: Lesson 17 : Method Overloading <br />

**Method Overriding**
* Same Method name
* Same parameter
* Different class

:point_right: Lesson 18 : Method Overriding <br />

**Constructor Overloading**
* Same Constructor
* Different parameter

:point_right: Lesson 19 : Constructor Overloading <br />

------
####INHERITANCE 
------
* Code reuse - efficient method
* One class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another Class
* ```extends``` is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class

:point_right: Lesson 20 : Polymorphism <br />

------
####ENCAPSULATION 
------
* Process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit
* Variables of a class is hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class [Data hiding]
* To achieve encapsulation in Java
	* Declare the variables of a class as private.
	* Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
* Benefits
	* The fields of a class can be made read-only or write-only
	* It provides you the control over the data

Sorry for the delay I was busy roaming, Will be updating today or tomorrow!
Thanks.
