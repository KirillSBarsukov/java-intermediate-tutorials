### Object Oriented Programming
	A - Abstraction
	P - Polymorphism
	I - Inheritance
	E - Encapsulation
	
**ABSTRACTION**
* Focus on essentials/idea rather than specific details/events
* Ignore the irrelevant or unimportant

**Abstract Class**
* May or may not contain abstract methods (Eg- method without body: ```public void get();```  )
* But, if a class have at least one abstract method, then the class must be declared abstract.
* If a class is declared abstract it cannot be instantiated.
* To use an abstract class you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.
* If you inherit an abstract class you have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it
